**Authors**: Yufan Zhang, Ruitian Wu, Tian Jin, Edward Wang, Rundong Hu

## Project Information

This repo presents a restaurant recommendation system developed using Yelpâ€™s public dataset. Our study aims to predict user preferences for new restaurants by integrating various data modeling techniques, focusing on both restaurant features and user interactions. We employed content-based filtering and collaborative filtering methods, including Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, and Alternating Least Squares (ALS), to construct a multi-faceted recommendation model. Our findings indicate that Linear Regression and Random Forest-based collaborative filtering outperformed other recommendation systems. The study also highlights the limitations of collaborative filtering on sparse datasets.
